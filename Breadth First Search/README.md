## How BFS works?

1) Select a starting point in your maze
2) Push this point into the BFS queue (the pivot)
3) Explore all its neighbours given the possible movements
4) Push every feasable neighbours into the queue
5) Pop your pivot cell from the queue
6) Select next pivot from the queue
7) Repeat from 3) until you find your destination
7bis) If destination cannot be reached, then the queue empties.
