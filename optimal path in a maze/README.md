# Finding optimal path in a Maze

In [finding path in a maze](https://github.com/javierdejuan/backtracking-Tutorial/tree/master/solving%20a%20maze) we have shown how backtracking works in a simple problem. However, the solution found was not optimal, since we can find a path with less steps.
The purpose of this tutorial is to find the optimal solution using recursive calls and backtracking techniques. We will need to make some subtils modifications to our latter code.
